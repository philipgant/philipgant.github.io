## About Me

I research how regulation develops, specializing in how those in misunderstood, yet mission-critical, sectors use procedural and policy mechanisms creatively to forge pathways through government and lawâ€”-particularly when none are readily available. I am especially interested in how, throughout that process, trust in complex systems like law and money is built and maintained. Trained as a legal historian of East Asia, I did my undergrad at Yale (2010) and my PhD at Harvard (2021), living along the way in Korea, China, and Japan. From 2020-2022, I was a postdoc at Yale, where I designed and taught "Faith in Law in East Asia: Beginnings to 1800." I then established Regulatory Ecosystems Group in order to apprehend and shape regulation in real time. If you too have been trying to map out the fault lines and peer over the horizons, I'd love to meet you.
